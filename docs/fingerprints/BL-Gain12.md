Bold: worth a look (see the findings and the details below).

How to read the differences: every difference is given as **relative / absolute**: relative = RMS(output - reference) / RMS(reference) in dB (0 dB: the change is as large as the signal, -40 dB: 1 %, +6 dB: twice the signal, as for a polarity inversion); absolute = RMS(output - reference) in dBFS. "identical": bit exact. For a silent reference only the absolute value counts.

## Findings
- nothing unusual found

## Parameters
Noise (peak 0.10) through the plugin with each parameter at 0.25 and 0.75 of its range, against the plugin at the base setting named in the last column; the larger change is shown. "no": below -80 dB in both passes. 2 parameters.

| no. | name | min | default | max | steps | automatable | changes the audio | measured with |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Bypass | off | off | on | switch | yes | -6.0 dB / -24.9 dBFS | the others at 0.75 |
| 1 | Gain | -12.0 | 0.0 | 12.0 | continuous | yes | -0.0 dB / -24.9 dBFS | defaults |

## Latency at three sample rates
An impulse (1.0 on all channels) after 4096 samples of silence, the plugin at its default parameters, 1.00 s watched. Measured = position of the largest output sample after the impulse. Reported = getLatencySamples() right after prepareToPlay and after the audio. Output before the peak: the largest output between the impulse and the peak, relative to the peak (a filter with pre-ringing, a look-ahead). Output before the impulse: signal the plugin makes of its own.

| rate | reported after prepare | reported after audio | measured | output before the peak | output before the impulse |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 44100 Hz | 0 | 0 | 0 | none | none |
| 48000 Hz | 0 | 0 | 0 | none | none |
| 96000 Hz | 0 | 0 | 0 | none | none |

## Delivery of parameters (A, A, B, A)
Four ways of giving the plugin its parameters, each with the settings A (defaults), A, B (the parameters that change the audio at 0.75), A. Repeatable: A, A, A the same (below -80 dB). Reacts: B differs from A (above -60 dB). As after a change: A and B equal the outputs of the same settings reached by a change of the parameters in the first way.

| way | repeatable | reacts | as after a change | result | A again (2nd / 3rd) | B against A | A, B against the references |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| one instance, parameters set after prepare (stream) | yes | yes | yes | ok | identical ; -142.5 dB / -167.4 dBFS | -0.0 dB / -24.9 dBFS | -142.5 dB / -167.4 dBFS ; identical |
| new instance per render, parameters set before prepare | yes | yes | yes | ok | identical ; identical | -0.0 dB / -24.9 dBFS | -142.5 dB / -167.4 dBFS ; -147.2 dB / -166.0 dBFS |
| new instance per render, parameters set after prepare | yes | yes | yes | ok | identical ; identical | -0.0 dB / -24.9 dBFS | -142.5 dB / -167.4 dBFS ; identical |
| new instance per render, after prepare every parameter first set to another value, then the target | yes | yes | yes | ok | identical ; identical | -0.0 dB / -24.9 dBFS | -151.2 dB / -176.0 dBFS ; -156.6 dB / -175.4 dBFS |

Most careful way that works: new instance per render, after prepare every parameter first set to another value, then the target.

## Block sizes
1.00 s of noise through the plugin (setting B) per block size, against block size 512. Steady state: the last 0.10 s (decides; below -100 dB = independent). Whole: the full render (a plugin that smooths its parameters per block differs here, but not in the steady state).

| block size | steady state | whole |
|---|---|---|
| 32 | identical | identical |
| 64 | identical | identical |
| 128 | identical | identical |
| 256 | identical | identical |
| 1024 | identical | identical |
| 2048 | identical | identical |
| 509 | identical | identical |

## Other
- deterministic (two instances, the same noise, bit exact): yes
- output stays finite (no NaN or infinity in the jump test): yes
- recovers from parameter jumps (every parameter that changes the audio to 0 and 1 and back, then the output of setting B again): yes
- digital silence in gives digital silence out: yes
